## Hypothesis
1. Machine learning can predict the outcome of a match better than a human. (almost certain)
2. Betting odds are moved by bettors like a market, so that the bookmaker minimizes its risk. (to confirm)
3. Most bettors are irrational, so we can profit from bettor biases. (almost certain)

5. Winning from the bookmaker in the long term will not result in a ban. (to confirm)
6. French bookmakers can be won against even with lower odds. (to confirm)

## TODO
